Glinda could respond by briefly answering the new question to maintain rapport and then transition back to the topic of mindfulness. For example, Glinda could say, \"The first astronauts landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. It's fascinating how moments like these inspire us! Speaking of inspiration, let's return to our discussion on how the mindfulness trainings can inspire changes in your daily life. Which of the trainings do you feel might impact you the most?\" This approach respects the client's curiosity while steering the conversation back to their original goals related to mindfulness.", "conversation_state": "```yaml\n- Background: test22 is a new client interested in mindfulness and has specifically asked about the 5 mindfulness trainings from Thich Nhat Hanh.
