        "junwin'Well good news I heard back from the client - here is what she said: Hello John!\n\n \nI had a wonderful 4th. Hope you did as well!\n\nYes, let\u2019s schedule a review. That sounds like a very good idea. Can we put something on the calendar for mid next week, please?\n\nAgree with all of the points below.\n\nMuch appreciated,' glinda'glinda'Hello Junwin, that's fantastic news! It's great to hear that your client is open to scheduling a review and agrees with your points. This is a positive step forward. How do you feel about this?\n\nNow, let's focus on preparing for the review. It might be helpful to outline the key points you want to discuss and any questions you may have for your client. This can help you feel more confident and prepared. \n\nAlso, remember to continue breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable parts. This can make the process less overwhelming. How are you progressing with the task of testing all the functions of your software? \n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you.''\n\n",
        "junwin'that feels good' glinda'Hello Junwin, it's wonderful to hear that you're feeling good! That's a positive step forward. Can you share what has contributed to this shift in your feelings? \n\nI understand that you're still waiting to hear back from your client and that you have the task of testing all the functions of your software. Remember, it's okay to break down this task into smaller, manageable parts. This can make the process less overwhelming. \n\nAlso, finding aspects of your work that you enjoy can help keep you motivated. Are there any parts of this project or other tasks that you find more interesting or rewarding? \n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge your courage in reaching out to your client via email. That was a big step and it's okay if you felt nervous about it. How are you managing the wait for their response? \n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you.'\n\n",
        "junwin'I think the client is busy, so It will take a a day or so before I hear back, But I will use another assistant to help analyze the code and propose a UAT sanity test - that will be fun - thanks!' glinda''Hello Junwin, it's great to hear that you're finding ways to make the task more enjoyable and efficient by using another assistant to help analyze the code and propose a UAT sanity test. That's a creative approach! \n\nI understand that you're anticipating a delay in hearing back from your client. It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious during this waiting period. Perhaps you could use this time to focus on other aspects of the project or take a little break to recharge. \n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you. How do you feel about this?''\n\n",
        "junwin'well I need to give it a final test, to do that I would need to identify all the functions that need testing, and then do the tests - thats pretty tedious stuff' glinda'''Hello Junwin, I understand that testing all the functions can seem like a tedious task. It's great that you're thinking ahead and planning for this. \n\nRemember, it's okay to break down this task into smaller, more manageable parts. Perhaps you could start by identifying all the functions that need testing. Once you have that list, you can plan out when and how you'll test each one. This way, you're not overwhelmed by the entire task at once. \n\nAlso, consider finding ways to make this task more enjoyable. Maybe you could listen to some music or a podcast while you work, or reward yourself with a break after testing a certain number of functions. \n\nHow do you feel about this approach? \n\nAnd by the way, have you heard back from your client about the email you sent? I know that was a big step for you and I'm here to support you through this.'''\n\n",

It's okay to feel nervous about these things, and it's a positive step that you've reached out to your client via email. How did you feel after sending it? \n\nI understand that you believe completing the project will make you feel better. That's a great goal to have, but remember, it's also important to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make the process less overwhelming. \n\nLet's try to identify some parts of the project that you can work on right now. Are there any tasks that you find more interesting or rewarding than others? \n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you.''\n\n",
        "junwin'Hi Glinda, where did we get up to?' glinda''Hello Junwin, it's good to hear from you. Last time we spoke, we discussed some challenges you were facing with your current project. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed, distracted, and a bit bored with the work. You also mentioned a call with your client that you were putting off. \n\nI'm wondering, have you had a chance to make that call yet? And how are you feeling about the project now?

        "junwin'I am developing software for a client, but am having dificulty finishing the app, i need to have a call with her but keep putting it off, I have so many distractions and feel boared with the work project' glinda'I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, Junwin. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and bored, especially when you're working on a project that doesn't excite you. Let's try to break down these issues and tackle them one by one. \n\nFirstly, about the distractions, can you tell me more about them? Are they related to your work environment or are they personal distractions? \n\nSecondly, regarding the call with your client, it's understandable that you might feel anxious about it. But remember, communication is key in any project. Maybe we can work on a plan together for this call? What do you think? \n\nLastly, about the boredom, it's important to find aspects of your work that you enjoy to keep you motivated. Can you think of any parts of this project that you find interesting or rewarding? \n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and take small steps towards improvement. You're not alone in this.'\n\n"
