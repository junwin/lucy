Have you and Arla discussed the pros and cons together? What are your main concerns, and what are the potential benefits you see?\n\n2. **Managing Emotions**:\n   - Moving can be an emotional process. How are you and Arla supporting each other through this transition? Are there any specific strategies or activities that help you both cope with these changes?\n\n### Action Planning\n1. **Creating a Fulfilling Routine**:\n   - As you transition into this new phase of life, what activities or routines can you incorporate to make your new space feel like home?

I'm glad to hear that you're considering setting guidelines and reducing TV time. It's also fantastic that your wife Arla supports you with healthier dessert options. Having a supportive partner can make a big difference in your journey.\n\nLet's dive a bit deeper into this. You mentioned that less TV would be good. Can you tell me more about your current TV habits? How much time do you typically spend watching TV at night, and what kinds of shows or programs do you watch? Understanding this can help us create a more tailored plan for you.\n\nRegarding the guidelines, what specific changes do you think would be most manageable for you? For example, would you prefer to set a limit on the number of hours you watch TV each night, or perhaps designate certain nights as TV-free? \n\nIt's also great to hear that Arla makes fruit/skyr-based desserts. How do you feel about incorporating more of these healthier options into your routine? Maybe you could even experiment with new recipes together, making it a fun and engaging activity.\n\nRemember, small steps and consistent efforts can lead to significant changes. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you. How do you feel about these ideas, and is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other way I can support you right now?'\n\n", "junwin'the main issue is if we watch the TV at night - i always want to eat then plus of cource if we go out to eat say for a family occasion' glinda'Hello Junwin, it's great to hear from you again. I understand that you're finding it challenging to stick to your health plan, especially when watching TV at night and during family outings. These situations can indeed be tough, but it's wonderful that you're aware of them. Awareness is the first step towards making positive changes.\n\nLet's explore this a bit more. Can you tell me what typically happens when you watch TV at night? What kinds of foods do you find yourself reaching for, and how do you feel before and after eating them? Understanding these patterns can help us find strategies to manage them better.\n\nSimilarly, when you go out for family occasions, what are the specific challenges you face? Is it the type of food available, the social pressure, or something else? \n\nOne approach we could consider is finding healthier alternatives or setting some guidelines for yourself during these times. For example, you could prepare a healthy snack before sitting down to watch TV or decide on a specific portion size in advance. During family outings, you might choose to focus on enjoying the company and conversation rather than the food.\n\nHow do you feel about these ideas? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other way I can support you right now? Remember, small steps and consistent efforts can lead to significant changes. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you.'\n\n", "junwin'well the main thing is that my doctor has insisted I loose about 20kg and get my blood sugar down, so I have been tracking all my food with the fit bit app about 5kg down so far, but its hard to stick to the plan' glinda'Hello Junwin, it's great to hear from you again.
