# Test case

##  Previous conversation:
In general I will not buy or select small cap financial instruments


## Conversation in a new session:
Which of these financial instruments do you think I would consider?

SPZ - small cap no dividends - high growth
IBM - large cap pays dividens - medium growth
AZT - medium cap pays dividends - medium growth

## Response
Based on the information you previously shared with me, it sounds like you would not consider SPZ, 
the small cap financial instrument, due to the high risk involved. However, you may be interested 
in IBM or AZT, which are large and medium cap respectively, and both offer dividends. 

The fact that IBM is a large cap stock may be appealing since it often signifies a well-established 
company with a stable track record, and its medium growth rate could offer a good balance of 
potential returns with minimized risk. 

Alternatively, AZT may also be worth considering since 
it's a medium cap stock with moderate growth and provides dividends which can offer passive income. 
Ultimately, the decision on which financial instrument to choose will depend on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

## When using semantic distancing to select previous conversation

## Response
Based on the information you provided, it seems like you might consider investing in IBM - a large cap stock that pays dividends and has medium growth potential. This is because you seem to prefer investing in larger, more established companies (such as IBM) and dividends provide a steady source of income from your investments. Additionally, since you are not interested in small cap stocks or those that do not pay dividends, the other options you presented (SPZ and AZT) may not be the best fit for your investment strategy.

# with none as selection type
As an AI assistant, I cannot say for certain which financial instrument you should consider because I would need to know more about your specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial strategy. However, based on the information you provided, it appears that the three financial instruments you mentioned have different characteristics and may be suitable for different types of investors. 

SPZ, which is a small cap stock with no dividends and high growth potential, may be suitable for investors who are comfortable with taking on higher risk and are seeking potentially higher returns. IBM, which is a large cap stock that pays dividends and has medium growth potential, may be suitable for investors who are seeking stable returns and are willing to hold the stock for a longer period of time. AZT, which is a medium cap stock that pays dividends and has medium growth potential, may be suitable for investors who are looking for a balance of income and growth. 

Ultimately, it's important to consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before investing in any financial instrument to ensure that it aligns with your investment objectives and overall financial strategy.


# with keyword

Based on your previous statement that you generally find small cap financial instruments to be too high risk, I think you would be more interested in IBM or AZT. IBM is a large cap financial instrument that pays dividends and has medium growth potential, while AZT is a medium cap financial instrument also with medium growth potential and that pays dividends. However, it's also important to keep in mind that other factors might influence your decision making process, such as your investment goals and risk tolerance levels.

If a similar question is make, then too many matches of potentially similar content are made so that is becomes hard to discriminate between the many potential candidates

I understand that it might be challenging to determine the relevance of questions and answers as more conversations unfold around a similar topic, like small cap stock instruments. To help with this issue, you can try the following approaches:

    Summarize the key points: After each response, create a summary of the essential information from the conversation. This will help you keep track of the main ideas and make it easier to identify relevant information.

    Use conversation history: When engaging in a conversation with the AI, include the relevant conversation history to ensure the context is maintained. This will help the AI provide more accurate and relevant responses.

    Be specific with your questions: When asking questions, be as specific as possible to guide the AI in providing the most relevant information. If necessary, include additional context or constraints to narrow down the scope of the response.

    Filter by keywords: Pay attention to the keywords in each conversation. You can use these keywords to quickly identify the main topics discussed and determine if they are relevant to your needs.

    Prioritize information: Rank the information provided by the AI based on its relevance and importance. This can help you focus on the most pertinent details and discard less relevant information.

By employing these strategies, you should be able to better manage the information provided by the AI and ensure that the responses are relevant to your needs.


Introducing a conversation ID to identify exchanges in a particular session chat can be an effective way to organize and manage conversations, especially when you want to restrict searching to a smaller set of exchanges. Using a namespace-like structure can help with this organization.

Additionally, partitioning certain aspects of the conversation, like "rules," can help you prioritize or rank information based on your requirements. To prioritize or rank keywords, consider the following strategies:

    Assign keyword importance: When extracting keywords from conversations, assign a predefined importance value based on their relevance to your main topic or question. For example, if you're discussing small cap financial instruments, "rules" might have a higher importance value than "dividends."

    Keyword frequency: Analyze the frequency of keywords within a conversation or a set of conversations. Higher frequency keywords could indicate greater importance or relevance to the main topic.

    Contextual relevance: Evaluate the context in which a keyword appears. If the keyword is closely related to the main topic or a critical point in the conversation, consider giving it higher priority.

    Conversation hierarchy: Establish a hierarchy within the conversations based on the keywords' priority. This can be done by grouping related keywords and ranking them based on importance or relevance.

    Manual curation: For more control over keyword prioritization, you can manually curate and rank keywords based on your understanding of their importance and relevance to the conversation.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more organized and manageable system for prioritizing and ranking keywords within conversations. This will help ensure that the most important information is easily accessible and well-structured.
